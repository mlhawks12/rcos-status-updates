## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

Last Week, I started writting code. I wrote preprocessing for the dataframe to be used in the model. It coverts all datatimes to EPOCH. Helping with the syntezing of the data. Learning about nerual networks

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

Learn more about ML and neural networks. Wrote code to handle null values in a dataframe. This was difficult because we can not just discount null values in medical data. Someone could have left it out for a variety of reasons like they weigh a lot or doesn't want to diclose it. So we use the random approach that just uses a random choice from the same column and creates a new column that lets you know if the data is actually null or missing

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology
Experience in Neural Networks and Machine learning, so we are mostly learning about that stuff
Nope 
## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
